# Custom PIN Tool — Memory Trace for Heterogeneous Memory Research

A multithreaded Intel PIN tool (`pinatrace_alloc_mt`) designed to record the memory access patterns of **Memcached 1.6.14**. Developed as part of a diploma thesis on caching strategies for heterogeneous memory systems (DRAM + NVM/PCM).

---

## Overview

This tool instruments a running Memcached process and produces a unified memory trace that captures:

- **Heap allocations and frees** — `malloc`, `calloc`, `realloc`, `reallocarray`, `aligned_alloc`, `memalign`, `valloc`, `pvalloc`, `posix_memalign`, `strdup`, `strndup`, `mmap`, `munmap`, `mremap`, and their glibc aliases.
- **Load/store memory accesses** — recorded per instruction, attributed to their containing heap region, stack region, or global image section.
- **Source-level metadata** — each allocation is tagged with its call site (file, line, function) via `addr2line`, with caching to avoid redundant lookups.
- **Thread roles** — Memcached worker threads are identified and labeled separately from internal/other threads.

The output trace is then used as input to the **DineroIV** cache simulator to study Write-Through vs. Write-Back caching policies under a DRAM-as-cache / NVM-as-main-memory architecture.

## Output Files

| File | Description |
|---|---|
| `pinatrace.out` | Unified trace: ALLOC/FREE events + load/store accesses |
| `pintool.log` | Diagnostic log: thread lifecycle, hooks installed, pending alloc state at exit |

### Trace Format

```
ALLOC <addr> <size> <tag> <file>:<line> [caller_ip]
FREE  <addr> <tag>
R <addr> <size> <region_tag> <src_file>:<line>
W <addr> <size> <region_tag> <src_file>:<line>
FREE-UNKNOWN <addr>   # mmap-backed allocations not seen by malloc hooks
```

## Knobs (Command-line Options)

| Knob | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `-use_libc_hooks` | `0` | Also hook `malloc`/`free` in libc (in addition to the application's own allocator) |
| `-src_debug` | `0` | Verbose diagnostics for source-location resolution |
| `-trace_untracked` | `0` | Log accesses that fall outside any tracked region |
| `-main_exe_only` | `1` | Restrict load/store tracing to the main executable image |
| `-trace_stack` | `1` | Include accesses to tracked per-thread stack regions |
| `-trace_globals` | `1` | Track accesses to global sections (`.data`, `.bss`, `.got`, etc.) |
| `-worker_only` | `0` | Restrict tracing to threads identified as Memcached worker threads |
| `-trace_libc_memops` | `0` | Include `memcpy`/`memset`/`strcmp` accesses when they touch a tracked heap region |

---

## Tracing Window (SIGUSR2)

Load/store recording is **off by default** to avoid capturing the Memcached startup and load phase.

Send `SIGUSR2` to the target process to **toggle** load/store tracing on or off:

```bash
kill -USR2 <memcached_pid>
```

This allows you to trace only the steady-state query phase (e.g., an mcperf benchmark run), keeping the trace clean and focused.

## Usage

### Build

```bash
# From the PIN kit root
make PIN_ROOT=/path/to/pin obj-intel64/pinatrace_alloc_mt.so
```

### Run

```bash
/path/to/pin/pin \
  -t obj-intel64/pinatrace_alloc_mt.so \
  -main_exe_only 1 \
  -trace_stack 1 \
  -trace_globals 1 \
  -- memcached -m 512 -t 4 &

MEMCACHED_PID=$!

# Start workload (e.g., mcperf)
mcperf -s 127.0.0.1 --loadonly -K 30 -V 200 -i uniform -n 1000000
kill -USR2 $MEMCACHED_PID   # start tracing
mcperf -s 127.0.0.1 -u 0.00 -K 30 -V 200 -i uniform -n 1000000 -t 60
kill -USR2 $MEMCACHED_PID   # stop tracing

kill $MEMCACHED_PID
```

## Design Notes

- **Thread-local state** is managed via a PIN TLS key (`g_tls_key`) with a per-thread `ThreadCtx` struct. Each thread has its own pending-alloc state, calloc stack, and role label.
- **Lock hierarchy**: `g_regions_lock` → `g_events_lock` → `g_stack_lock` → `g_src_cache_lock` → `g_img_cache_lock` → `g_hook_lock`. Never acquire in reverse order.
- **`FREE-UNKNOWN` entries**: Occur when glibc services large allocations directly via `mmap` (without calling `malloc`), so the PIN hooks never see the original allocation.
- **Source location caching**: `addr2line` results are cached by `(image_path, image_offset)` to avoid repeated subprocess calls on the hot path.
- **Image-to-IP caching**: `GetImgFromIpCached` avoids calling `PIN_LockClient` on every load/store by maintaining a separate hash map protected by `g_img_cache_lock`.
- **Deduplication of hooked routines**: `TryMarkHooked` (via `g_hooked_rtn_addrs`) prevents double-instrumentation of aliased symbols (e.g., `__GI___malloc` vs. `malloc`).

## Requirements

- Intel PIN (tested with PIN 3.x, x86-64)
- Linux (x86-64), glibc
- `addr2line` in `PATH` (for source-level tagging)
- Memcached 1.6.14 compiled with debug symbols (`-g`) for accurate source attribution
